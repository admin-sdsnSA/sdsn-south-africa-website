title: SDSN South Africa universities propel up the 2022 THE Impact Rankings
desc: '<p>According to the latest Times Higher Education (THE) <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2022/overall#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/undefined">Impact
  Rankings</a> (2022), released in the first week of May, several SDSN South African
  universities moved up convincingly in the rankings which are based on the 17 <a
  href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs">SDGs</a> which in turn are designed
  to address the most serious and critical global challenges in the world. The SDGs
  offer an integrated framework for ensuring that global development balances social,
  economic and environmental sustainability.</p><p>The University of Pretoria (UP)
  has been named South Africa’s second-best (joint second) and Africa’s third-best
  (joint third) university. </p><p>UP also featured among the global top 50 and top
  100 universities in terms of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>Nelson
  Mandela University ranked highly in SDGs 17 and 15, as well as moving up to sixth
  spot.</p><p>The University of Cape Town also made a strong showing once again </p><p>This
  year, a record number of 1 406 universities (up from 1 240 in 2021) from 106 countries/regions
  featured in the Impact Rankings, which offer a way to gauge a higher education institution’s
  performance on the international stage in terms of the widely adopted SDGs. A university’s
  overall score – and thus rank – is determined by its combined performance in its
  top three SDGs (each weighting 26%, with SDG 17 weighting 22%). Using calibrated
  metrics and indicators across four key areas – research, teaching, outreach and
  stewardship – the rankings assess hundreds of quantitative and qualitative evidence
  that tangibly measure the impact of higher education institutions in addressing
  urgent global challenges.</p><p>UP is ranked among the top 50 universities in the
  world in terms of SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth: position 44) and SDG 15
  (Life on Land: position 30). In addition, the University is ranked among the top
  100 universities in the world in SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:
  position 88) and SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals: position 86).</p><p>The University
  has also retained its position (201 – 300) in SDG 3 (Health and Wellbeing) and SDG
  4 (Quality Education), and improved its position in SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong
  Institutions: 101 –200). When it first participated, UP was ranked between 101 and
  200 in SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).</p><p>In addition, UP is ranked first in South
  Africa in SDGs 9 and 15 and second in SDGs 3, 16 and 17.</p><p>Eighty African universities
  in 10 countries featured in the Impact Rankings. Commenting on the performance of
  African universities, Phil Baty, Chief Knowledge Officer at the THE World University
  Rankings, stated: “As the Impact Rankings focus on social and economic impact, through
  universities’ contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals, we can recognise
  niche strengths and uncover real pockets of excellence across the African continent.”
  It is clear that African universities are taking a lead in improving social realities
  and are taking pride in their contribution towards this.</p><p>Since the launch
  of the <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/news/post_3052474-up-launches-national-network-to-support-un-sustainable-development-goals-">Sustainable
  Development Solutions Network</a> this year, the objective of which is to mobilise
  and support South African universities and other leading research institutions to
  promote the SDGs in South Africa as well as South Africa’s contribution to the SDGs
  globally.</p><p></p>'
