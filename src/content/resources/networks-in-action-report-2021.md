"The 2021 Networks in Action Report is an inspiring record of leadership by universities around the world to collaborate and promote urgentlyneeded solutions for the SDGs.

In the face of a complex global crisis, SDSN’s Networks have demonstrated their commitment, ingenuity, resilience and flexibility.

The worldwide growth of SDSN membership and the five new SDSN networks are testimony to the vital importance and relevance of the university networks.” - Jeffrey Sachs, President, SDSN
