Dear SDSN Community,

This year’s UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5), which took place online and in Nairobi earlier this month, was focused on “[Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.unep.org/environmentassembly/about-unea-5).” Following this theme, SDG Action’s most recent publication, [Environment Special Focus](https://sdg-action.org/sdg-action-publications/environment-special-focus-2022/), looks at how human activity is threatening vital Earth-systems processes, and sets out what needs to be done to protect the environment on which life depends.

SDSN research teams and networks have a number of projects and reports relevant to this year’s UNEA theme, including a policy brief on ​​[Pathways for Food and Land Use Systems to Contribute to Global Biodiversity Targets](https://resources.unsdsn.org/pathways-for-food-and-land-use-systems-to-contribute-to-global-biodiversity-targets), a study [Addressing International spillovers embodied in EU’s food supply chains](https://www.unsdsn.org/making-globalization-and-trade-work-for-people-and-planet-international-spillovers-embodied-in-eus-food-supply-chains), and past SDG Index work [featured in the Report on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) presented to the French Minister of Ecological Transition](https://www.unsdsn.org/sdsn-dans-le-rapport-rapport-autour-des-objectifs-de-developpement-durable-odd-presente-a-la-ministre-francaise-de-la-transition-ecologique).

Read on for more opportunities and events, SDSN news and updates, and open positions within our network.
