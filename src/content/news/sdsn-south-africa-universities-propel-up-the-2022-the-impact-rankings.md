  universities moved up convincingly in the rankings which are based on the 17 <a

  to address the most serious and critical global challenges in the world. The SDGs
  offer an integrated framework for ensuring that global development balances social,

  on the international stage in terms of the widely adopted SDGs. A university’s overall
  score – and thus rank – is determined by its combined performance in its top three
  SDGs (each weighting 26%, with SDG 17 weighting 22%). Using calibrated metrics and
  indicators across four key areas – research, teaching, outreach and stewardship
  – the rankings assess hundreds of quantitative and qualitative evidence that tangibly
  measure the impact of higher education institutions in addressing urgent global
  challenges.</p><p>Eighty African universities in 10 countries featured in the Impact
  Rankings. Commenting on the performance of African universities, Phil Baty, Chief
  Knowledge Officer at the THE World University Rankings, stated: “As the Impact Rankings
  focus on social and economic impact, through universities’ contribution to the Sustainable
  Development Goals, we can recognise niche strengths and uncover real pockets of
  excellence across the African continent.” It is clear that African universities
  are taking a lead in improving social realities and are taking pride in their contribution
  towards this.</p><p>Since the launch of the <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/news/post_3052474-up-launches-national-network-to-support-un-sustainable-development-goals-">Sustainable
  Development Solutions Network</a> South Africa this year, the objective of which

  institutions to promote the SDGs in South Africa as well as South Africa’s contribution
